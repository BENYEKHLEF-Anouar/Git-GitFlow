# The hotfix Branch in Git Flow

## Overview

In the Git Flow workflow, a **hotfix** branch is used to quickly address critical issues or bugs found in the production environment. These fixes are made directly from the **main** branch to minimize downtime and then merged back into both **main** and **develop** to keep all branches up to date.

## Key Characteristics

- **Created from:** `main`  
- **Merged into:** `main` and `develop`  
- **Purpose:** To fix urgent issues in the production release (e.g., security bugs, crash fixes)  
- **Naming convention:** `hotfix/<version>` (e.g., `hotfix/1.0.1`, `hotfix/2.2.3`)  
- **Temporary branch:** Deleted after merging and tagging the release  

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Start a hotfix branch from main
git flow hotfix start 1.0.1

# (Optional) Publish the hotfix branch to remote
git flow hotfix publish 1.0.1

# Apply and commit the fix
git commit -am "Fix critical login issue in production"

# Finish the hotfix
git flow hotfix finish 1.0.1
```

## Explanation of Commands

- `git flow hotfix start <version>` → Creates a new branch `hotfix/<version>` from `main`.  
- `git flow hotfix publish <version>` → Pushes the hotfix branch to the remote repository for collaboration.  
- `git flow hotfix finish <version>` → Merges the fix into both `main` and `develop`, tags the commit with the hotfix version (e.g., `v1.0.1`), and deletes the hotfix branch locally.

| Purpose           | Quickly fix critical bugs in production           |
| Contains          | Emergency patches, urgent security or stability fixes |

## Diagram (Text Representation)

```
main ────────────────┐
                      ├── hotfix/1.0.1
                      │     ├── fix → main (production)
                      │     └── merge → develop (sync fix)
develop ──────────────┘
```

The **hotfix** branch ensures production issues can be resolved immediately without interrupting ongoing development work in **develop**, maintaining both stability and productivity.
