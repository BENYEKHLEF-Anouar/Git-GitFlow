# The develop Branch in Git Flow

## Overview

The **develop** branch is the main integration branch in the Git Flow model. It serves as the staging area for all completed features and fixes before they are released to production.

## Key Characteristics

- **Base for feature branches** — All new features (`feature/*`) are created from **develop**.
- **Integration point** — Finished features are merged back into **develop**.
- **Pre-release branch** — Contains the latest working code ready for testing before release.
- **Stable but not production-ready** — The code should build and run correctly but may still require final QA.

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Create a new feature branch from develop
git flow feature start login-system

# Work on the feature, then finish it (merges into develop)
git flow feature finish login-system

# Later, when preparing a release
git flow release start v1.0
```

After testing and preparing the release, the release branch is merged into both **main** (for production) and **develop** (to include any updates made during the release process).

| Source              | Created from **main** during Git Flow initialization           |
| Purpose             | Integrate all new features and fixes before release            |
| Merged into         | **main** (via release branch)                                  |
| Branches created from it | `feature/*`, `release/*`                                   |

```
main ───────┐
             ├── develop ───┬── feature/add-login
             │               ├── feature/add-dashboard
             │               └── release/v1.0
             │
             └── hotfix/v1.0.1
```

The **develop** branch ensures a smooth workflow between development and production, keeping the **main** branch always clean and ready for deployment.
